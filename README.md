# Cloudflare Workers Internship Application: Full-Stack

## What is this?

A project for [CloudFlare's 2020 Internships](https://github.com/cloudflare-internship-2020/internship-application-fullstack). It's a serverless web app that randomly sends you to one of two pages. Once there, it stores a cookie on your device, so you'll see the same site when you return. If you want to see a different site, delete the cookie or use incognito mode on your browser.
